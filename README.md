# MangOverlay

## About

MangOverlay is an open source GUI app for managing your MangoHud settings. It aims to provide as much flexibility with it's settings as possible. Currently only configures the system mangohud config file, in future I'd like to also add support for flatpak mangohud.

## Installation

MangOverlay will be available as flatpak once it arrived at a point where I feel it makes sense. Currently you can download the binary from the latest Release and go from there.
